This directory contains tests for the Emailinator project.

## Integration Tests

### Inbound Email Tests

The `inbound_email_tests` test the complete inbound email processing pipeline
from email submission to database storage.

#### Prerequisites

The integration tests automatically set the required environment variables and
do not require any manual setup. However, you need to ensure that:

1. **Local Supabase is running**: Start your local Supabase development server
2. **Edge Function environment**: The local Supabase Edge Function needs to be
   running with the following environment variables:

```bash
POSTMARK_BASIC_USER="postmark-basic-user"
POSTMARK_BASIC_PASSWORD="postmark-basic-password"
POSTMARK_ALLOWED_IPS="127.0.0.1"
INBOUND_EMAIL_DOMAIN="in.emailinator.app"
```

These can be set in your `supabase/functions/.env` file (not in Git):

#### Running Integration Tests

You can run the integration tests in several ways:

**Option 1: Using Make**

```bash
make test-integration
```

**Option 2: Running with pytest directly**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest -s test_integration -v
```

The integration tests are designed to run under pytest only.

#### What the Tests Do

The integration test performs the following:

1. **Environment Variable Setup**: Automatically sets all required environment variables
2. **Email Submission**: Sends all `.eml` files in `test_integration/email_data/` to the
   Supabase inbound-email function using the `send_to_supabase` tool

If any step fails, the subsequent steps are not executed.

#### Test Data

The test uses email files located in `test_integration/email_data/`. These are real email
files in `.eml` format that represent various types of emails that the system
should be able to process.

#### Output

The tests provide detailed output showing:

- Environment variable setup status
- Database reset status
- Individual email processing results
- Overall success/failure summary

#### Troubleshooting

**Local Supabase Not Running**

Ensure your local Supabase development server is running with `supabase start`.

**Edge Function Environment Variables Not Set**

If emails fail to process, ensure the Edge Function has the required environment
variables set in `supabase/functions/.env.local`.

**Supabase CLI Not Found**

Install the Supabase CLI following the
[official documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli).

**Edge Function Errors**

If submissions fail, check the inbound-email function logs and verify required
environment variables.

**Email Sending Failures**

```
âœ— Failed to send example.eml
```

Solution: Check the Supabase function logs and ensure the inbound-email function
is deployed and running.
